# Sudoku-Solver
A gui program, which takes an .png image and extracts the digits out of the image and solves the maze. If an image is not recognized, you also got the option to type the the digits in manually.
I did not wrote all of the code on my own, I converted the project into a maven project and used the Tess4J library to extract the digits out of the image, but everything else is written entirely by myself.
The installer only works if you are creating a directory which is named "Sudoku-Solver-Installer", located in the "Downloads" directory. The images must be stored the the subdirectory src/images. (for more information read the code from the filesystem package) 
I hope you'll have fun with my code :)
