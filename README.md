# Sudoku-Solver
A gui program, which takes an .png image and extracts the digits out of the image and solves the maze. If an image is not recognized correctly, you also got the option to type the the digits in manually.

The installer only works if you are creating a directory which is named "Sudoku-Solver-Installer", located in the "Downloads" directory. The images must be stored in 
the subdirectory src/images. (for more information read the code from the filesystem package)

If you download this project please make sure that you put the files in the right location. (the right path can be found in the Installer- and FileHandler class)

I did not wrote all of the code on my own, I used the Tess4j library to extract the digits out of the image, but everything else is written entirely by myself.

I hope you'll have fun with my code :)
